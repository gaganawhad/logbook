The app uses acts_as_taggable_on_steroids http://github.com/jviney/acts_as_taggable_on_steroids plugin to allow and manage tags added to the posts
The app also uses will_paginate gem http://wiki.github.com/mislav/will_paginate/ that has been installed to paginate the table entries. 
The seeds file uses faker gem http://faker.rubyforge.org/ that has been installed to generate fake data inorder to populate the database. 

Links to github are generated inside the application_helper. 

== Models
The Models were generated using scaffolding. In LogBookEntries github_project_id and user_id are foreign keys. So LobBookEntries is the referencing table and Users and GithubProjects are referenced tables. 
Therefore we use User has_many log_book_entries and GithubProject has_many log_book_entries and LogBookEntry belongs_to User and belongs_to GithubProject

Tables to store tags are added by the acts_as_taggable_on_steroids . These tables were automatically created. 

In the LogBookEntry model the we are using a find_by_query method that helps search the table using a query entered by the user. 

Indices have been created on github_id and user_id columns of log_book_entries table in order to speed-en up query retrieval. 


== Helpers
Most helpers are view helpers. They are used to print the particular item in a much more readable or pleasing manner. They are quite straightforward. The get_direction helper contains logic to get the right direction ( ascending or descending) for the entries that are displayed in the table. 


== Controllers
Active controllers initializes a bunch of instance variables that are used to pass to views and then back based on what order we want the table entries to be displayed. 
These variables are used in the search_controller and the log_book_entries_controller. 

The search controller has been created to show some of the entries that have been searched for by using either tags or a search query.  


== Views
The search box created in _search_box.html.erb is used in the search layout in order to have a search box on every page that in that controller. It has also been added to the Index page of the log_book_entries controller. the search box uses get method. If it would not, re-ordering of entries in the query action would not have worked because the query would not be known. 

The _table.html.erb partial has been created to have it be called from various views so that the same table can be used in various views. 

The _table_entry.html.erb is created to have multiple entries be populated over the table. It is currently being called form _table.html.erb using :collections symbol.P
